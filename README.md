# lookfor: Find what you're looking for #

**lookfor** is an R port of Stata's `lookfor` command, which helps you find stuff you're looking for inside a dataset (e.g., variables, variable values, variable labels, etc.).

## Package Installation ##

The package might be available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lookfor/) and can be installed directly in R using:

```R
install.packages("lookfor")
```

The latest development version on GitHub can be installed using **devtools**:

```R
if(!require("devtools")){
    install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")
}
install_github("leeper/lookfor")
```
