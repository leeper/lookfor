# lookfor: Find what you're looking for #

**lookfor** is an R port of Stata's `lookfor` command, which helps you find stuff you're looking for inside a dataset (e.g., variables, variable values, variable labels, etc.).

## Examples ##

Stata's `lookfor` command searches variables and variable labels for an exact matching text string:

```
. webuse auto
(1978 Automobile Data)

. lookfor weight

              storage   display    value
variable name   type    format     label      variable label
---------------------------------------------------------------------
weight          int     %8.0gc                Weight (lbs.)

. lookfor ft

              storage   display    value
variable name   type    format     label      variable label
---------------------------------------------------------------------
trunk           int     %8.0g                 Trunk space (cu. ft.)
turn            int     %8.0g                 Turn Circle (ft.)
```

This is helpful and something easily replicated by searching within the `names` attribute of a data.frame. But R allows multiple objects to be present at one time, meaning that it would be time consuming to `grep` the names of all data.frames that might be active in memory at any given point in time. Similarly, those R objects are also themselves named, have numerous other attributes (`rownames`, `colnames`, `levels`, `class`, etc.), and might be stored within lists or environments. While the `lookfor` command in Stata is helpful, it's actually solving a relatively simple problem. Porting `lookfor` to R requires a much more robust solution for searching many different features of potentially numerous data objects stored in various parts of the R environment.

The major weakness of Stata's `lookfor` command is that it relies only on a plain text, exact matching search algorithm. This makes it difficult to search for variables or labels that match a pattern (e.g., a pattern that might easily be described by a regular expression). As a result, the R port uses `grepl` to find matches, meaning that regular expressions are used by default when trying to find something and arguments can be passed via `...` to control the behavior of `grepl` (e.g., setting `fixed=TRUE` will match an exact string, and `perl=TRUE` will use Perl-style regular expressions).

### Look in a data.frame ###

```{r, results="hide"}
options(width = 100)
```

A basic use case is to search for an observation or a variable within a dataset.

```{r}
library("lookfor")
data(USArrests)

# look for observation
lookin(USArrests, "Alaska")

# look for variable
lookin(USArrests, "Assault")
```


### Look in an environment ###

Relatedly, it is possible to search for objects within an environment (and values or attributes within those objects).

```{r, results="hold"}
x <- new.env()
x$mtcars <- mtcars
x$cars <- letters[1:10]
x$cards <- 1:5
lookin(x, "car")
```


### Look in a list ###

And the same can be applied to a potentially deeply nested list.

```{r}
m <- lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
lookin(m, "mpg")
```


### Look everywhere ###

Lastly, the `lookfor` command can be used to look anywhere (within `.GlobalEnv`, the R search path, objects within objects on the search path, loaded namespaces, etc.).

```{r}
lookfor("package")
```

### Look using regular expression ###

As noted above, Stata's `lookfor` command can only match exact/partial character strings. The R port by uses `grepl`, meaning that regular expressions are supported by default, thus allowing for complex pattern matching.

```{r}
data(mtcars)

# Look for car names containing letters and numbers (anywhere)
lookfor("[[:alpha:]]+ [[:digit:]]")

# Look for car names containing letters and numbers (in mtcars)
lookin(mtcars, "[[:alpha:]]+ [[:digit:]]")
```

### Search `comment()` values ###

R's `comment()` function is an underutilized feature that allows users to attach hidden comments to R objects. This is intended (see `? comment`) for helping to annotate R objects with relevant metadata. The value of `comment()` for an object is `NULL` unless it has been set, in which case it is usually a character vector of length 1 (or possibly greater). `lookfor` searches `comment()` values automatically, allowing you to make better use of these annotations.

```{r}
m1 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
comment(m1) <- "model using continuous cylinder"

m2 <- lm(mpg ~ factor(cyl), data = mtcars)
comment(m2) <- "model using factor of cylinder"

lookfor("model using", fixed = TRUE)
```
